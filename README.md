# Image-Bubble-Sort
Takes a .bmp, randomises the location of each pixel and then runs a cheeky bubble sort on that bad boy. Why? Who knows

# GOT A BMP FILE YOU WANT TO A PROGRAM TO SCRAMBLE UP AND THEN SPIT OUT NEARLY A MILLION USELESS IMAGES? WANT THEM THEN TO COMBINIE FOR A TOTAL OF POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF GIGABYTES OF ABSOLUTELY SHIT ALL??

>looks like you submled into the right place then

# WHAT'S IT ACTUALLY DO?
>Takes in an image (must be bmp rn casue I want it to take up literally as much space as possible), such as this: ![example photo](https://github.com/LewisFramps/Image-Bubble-Sort/blob/master/Danny's%20Sorted!.bmp)

>then it scrambles it up real good until it looks like this: ![example photo](https://github.com/LewisFramps/Image-Bubble-Sort/blob/master/Danny's%20not%20sorted.bmp)

> then it outputs an image for every completed cycle of bubble sort(so each time the loop resets), for example this was the 139210th image that my ART spat out: ![example photo](https://github.com/LewisFramps/Image-Bubble-Sort/blob/master/PleaseDanny_139210.bmp)

> after probably a stupid amount of time and a stupid amount of storage space, it spits a sorted image out: ![example photo](https://github.com/LewisFramps/Image-Bubble-Sort/blob/master/Danny's%20Sorted!.bmp)

> you may think that it's similar to the first shown image. That's because it literally is identical to it. There's literally no point for this program but to waste time and resources.
